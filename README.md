<h2>What spine <b>is</b></h2>
<p>
Spine as the name aptly suggests is a Barebones SASS CSS class based framework to give any project a backbone whilst keeping page elements solid.
</p>

<p>
Spine is simple and comes without all the bloat that comes with the many of the framework available. The key driving idea behind Spine is to save time without doing those annoying framework class overides, whilst creating a website that does not look like it made with a framework.
