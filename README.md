<h2>What spine <b>is</b></h2>

<p>
Boootstrap is a great framework, but what if you not quite need everything that comes with it? 
</p>

<p>
This is where Spine comes in. Its a responsive CSS/HTML framework to get you started on any web project going without all the bloat that comes with the some of the framework available.
Save time without doing those annoying framework class overides. :)
</p>

<h2>What spine <b>is not</b></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Is not a completed Framework, and does not include and scripting</li>
</ul>



<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>
All padding and Margins untilize the more responsivie friendly Relative REM unit, as oppesed absolute units such as Px. 
</p>

<p>
Column. units upto 12 columns layout.
</p>

<h2>Todo</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Image classes</li>
    <li>Remove all Px units</li>
    <li>Finish and test media queries</li>
</ul>
